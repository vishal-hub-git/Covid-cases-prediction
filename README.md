# Covid Cases Prediction

This covid cases prediction project is done for Flipr AI Hackathon which was conducted all over India. There were 2 parts of problems given to us for solving.
Problem 1: The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the Covid Cases of a City on 1st September 2020. The output file 01 should contain only City and the respective Covid Cases for the test data.
Problem 2: The Foreign Visitors of a city is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up with a Time-series prediction model. Using the Foreign Visitors predicted by the model, you need to calculate the Covid Cases on 1st Oct 2020 for every City in the test data. The output file 02 should contain only City and the respective Covid Cases on 1st October.
